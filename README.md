- React-redux ( with redux-thunk and redux-persist ) 
- axios
- React-router
- styled-components

## What i think about this app ?
I think this is useful app, maybe without many features but my goal was to make simple app 
which wan't be too complicated and i think that i reach this goal. On the other hand i see 
many problems with this app, like 'not interesting' UI but i will correct this.
